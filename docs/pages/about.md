# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br><br>
As a PhD candidate in Computational and Data Sciences at Chapman University, I have developed a thorough knowledge in mathematics and statistics behind data science techniques and machine learning algorithms. In addition, I have mastered implementing them using Python( Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensoFlow, etc) and R( tidyverse packages).<br>

I have acquired numerous hands-on experiences in data analysis, machine learning and data visualization via conducting multiple projects such as Adverse Drug Event detection with NLP, Data extraction from unstructured medical documents with NLP, fraudulent transactions detection, Portfolio Optimization, Customer Churn prediction and Causal Inference from Longitudinal Data. <br>

I am comfortable with many general tools in Computer science and data analytics field such as Version Control with Git, Shell scripting, Bash, Google Cloud Platform(GCP), R Markdown, Latex, Linux. <br>

Also, I use immersed boundary method, which is a combination of Lagrangian and Eulerian approach, to answer biological fluid dynamics questions.<br>
